            <b>Flipkart Private Limited </b>is an Indian e-commerce company, headquartered in Bangalore, 
            and incorporated in Singapore as a private limited company. The company initially focused 
            on online book sales before expanding into other product categories such as consumer
             electronics, fashion, home essentials, groceries, and lifestyle products.[5][6]

            The service competes primarily with Amazon India and domestic rival Snapdeal.[7][8] As
             of FY23, Flipkart held a 48% market share in the Indian e-commerce industry.[9] Flipkart
              has a dominant position in the apparel segment, bolstered by its acquisition of Myntra,
               and was described as being "neck and neck" with Amazon in the sale of electronics 
               and mobile phones.[10]
